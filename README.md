# Game Dev Course 2021 @ FMI

This is the official repository of the Game Dev Course @ FMI Edition 2022.
Here we will publish all the tasks for the homework of the course.

## Goals for this course

In the end of the course, every one of the participants will have two finished games. The first one will be build part by part with every single homework and every single practice. In the semester it is planned for us all to discuss all of the core principles of the Game Development. The second game will be given as a course project and the students will have the freedom to use all the knowledge from the course.
